# Eye_Tracking

In the code I have mentioned "trial_data.csv". This csv is the main dataset on which our model is trained. This csv file we have got after extracting the time series data from the 57 participants data. The code for extracting the time series data along with its target coordinates are present in "dataset_preparation.ipynb" file.
